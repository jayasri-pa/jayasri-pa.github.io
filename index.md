# Jayasri PA 

What's Jay upto? Well... -> A first-year Ph.D student at the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in), [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)

I am fortunate that life has `branch-taken` [@CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/) spearheaded by the awesome [Prof.Biswa~~bandhan Panda~~](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/). I am on a joyride of systems engineering, pondering over the intersection of microarchitecture and humanity.

If you share similar interests or cool ideas to discuss/learn and wanted to make friends, feel free to reach out to me! &#x1F604;

Well that's not all, my average day is also filled with photographing street animals, jogging and lurking on discord servers making new friends. Not a fan of leg days, but yeah I still do them.
